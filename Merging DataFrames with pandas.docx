1. Preparing data
- Reading DataFrames from multiple files
    # Import pandas
    import pandas as pd

    # Read 'Bronze.csv' into a DataFrame: bronze
    bronze = pd.read_csv('Bronze.csv')

    # Read 'Silver.csv' into a DataFrame: silver
    silver = pd.read_csv('Silver.csv')

    # Read 'Gold.csv' into a DataFrame: gold
    gold = pd.read_csv('Gold.csv')

    # Print the first five rows of gold
    print(gold.head())

- Reading DataFrames from multiple files in a loop
    # Import pandas
    import pandas as pd

    # Create the list of file names: filenames
    filenames = ['Gold.csv', 'Silver.csv', 'Bronze.csv']

    # Create the list of three DataFrames: dataframes
    dataframes = []
    for filename in filenames:
        dataframes.append(pd.read_csv(filename))

    # Print top 5 rows of 1st DataFrame in dataframes
    print(dataframes[0].head())
